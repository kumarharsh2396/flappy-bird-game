    The bird is the 'hero' of this game.  The player can make it climb
    (ascend quickly), otherwise it sinks (descends more slowly).  It must
    pass through the space in between pipes (for every pipe passed, one
    point is scored); if it crashes into a pipe, the game ends.

    Attributes:
    x: The bird's X coordinate.
    y: The bird's Y coordinate.
    msec_to_climb: The number of milliseconds left to climb, where a
        complete climb lasts Bird.CLIMB_DURATION milliseconds.

    Constants:
    WIDTH: The width, in pixels, of the bird's image.
    HEIGHT: The height, in pixels, of the bird's image.
    SINK_SPEED: With which speed, in pixels per millisecond, the bird
        descends in one second while not climbing.
    CLIMB_SPEED: With which speed, in pixels per millisecond, the bird
        ascends in one second while climbing, on average.  See also the
        Bird.update docstring.
    CLIMB_DURATION: The number of milliseconds it takes the bird to
        execute a complete climb.
